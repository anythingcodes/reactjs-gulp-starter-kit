# ReactJS Gulp Starter Kit

A barebones ReactJS starter kit, hooked up with Gulp, Sass as a CSS preprocessor, Browserify, Browsersync, and other goodness in a NodeJS environment. CSS and JS is minified automatically, and changes to the JS and Sass within `src` are automatically minified and refreshed, so you can see your changes in the browser instantaneously.

## Running Locally

To run locally, first install dependencies one time:

`npm i`

in the directory. Once complete, issue:

`gulp`

every time you want to spin up your local server. Your browser should open `http://localhost:3000` with an extremely simple ReactJS page!

Make Sass and JS changes in `src` and watch them automatically update in your browser.
